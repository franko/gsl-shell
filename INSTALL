GSL Shell 2.2

** BUILD INSTRUCTION

GSL Shell needs the following external libraries:

- AGG library, version 2.5
- GSL Library, version 1.14 or 1.15
- GNU readline library (on Linux only)
- Freetype2 library, version 2.4.10
- FFTW shared library, version 3.3+

To build the Graphical user interface you will need also the FOX 1.6 library.

Optionally you can install an optimized BLAS library like ATLAS or OPENBLAS. These can greatly improve the speed for operation on large matrices.

Please note that the Lua implementation used in GSL Shell is included with
the source code so that you don't need any external Lua library or
executable.

On Linux you just need to make sure that the appropriate dev packages are included for each of the library given above.

The main compilation options for GSL Shell are located in the file "makeconfig". You can modify this file to change some compilation options if you want. In particular you may want to change the PREFIX path to something else than "/usr/local".

If you have troubles you can have a look to the "makepackages" files where the include and link flags for each library are defined. In the file "makedefs" you will have additional compiling options but normally you should not need to modify this file.

The makepackages files call the pkg-config command to determine some of the
options.  If the pkg-config utility is not on your computer, you will
need to either install it or replace those calls with hard-coded flags.

Once you have modified the file "makeconfig" you can just give:

> make

to build the software and

> make install

to install it.

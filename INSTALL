
GSL Shell 2.0

** BUILD INSTRUCTION

GSL Shell needs the following external libraries:

- AGG library, version 2.5
- GSL Library, version 1.14 or 1.15
- GNU readline library (on Linux only)

Please note that the Lua implementation used in GSL Shell is included with
the source code so that you don't need any external Lua library or
executable.

Once you are sure that the AGG and GSL libraries are properly installed
edit the file "makepackages". For the Linux platform locate the part
between the "else" and "endif" keyword and modify the following variables:

AGG_INCLUDES
AGG_LIBS
GSL_INCLUDES
GSL_LIBS

so that the AGG and GSL libraries can be located. Please note that if the
libraries are installed in the standard locations you can leave empty the
variables AGG_INCLUDES and GSL_INCLUDES.

Once you have modified the file "makepackage" you can just give

> make

to build the software and

> make install

to install it.

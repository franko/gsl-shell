Nonlinear Least Squares fit
===========================

Overview
--------

GSL Shell provides support for nonlinear least squares fitting for user-defined data and functions.

The problem of multidimensional nonlinear least-squares fitting requires
the minimization of the squared residuals of n functions, f\ :sub:`i`, in p
parameters, x\ :sub:`i`,

.. math::
     \Phi(x) = \frac{1}{2} || F(x) ||^2
             = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x_1, ..., x_p)^2

All algorithms proceed from an initial guess using the linearization,

.. math::
     \psi(p) = || F(x+p) || \simeq || F(x) + J p ||

where x is the initial point, p is the proposed step and J is the
Jacobian matrix J\ :sub:`ij` = df\ :sub:`i` / dx\ :sub:`j`.
Additional strategies are used
to enlarge the region of convergence.  These include requiring a
decrease in the norm ||F|| on each step or using a trust region to
avoid steps which fall outside the linear regime.

To perform a weighted least-squares fit of a nonlinear model Y(x,t)
to data (t\ :sub:`i`, y\ :sub:`i`) with independent Gaussian errors
|sgr|\ :sub:`i`, use
function components of the following form

.. math::
     f_i = (Y(x, t_i) - y_i) / \sigma_i

Note that the model parameters are denoted by x in this chapter since
the non-linear least-squares algorithms are described geometrically
(i.e. finding the minimum of a surface).  The independent variable of
any data to be fitted is denoted by t.

With the definition above the Jacobian is
:math:`J_{ij} =(1 / \sigma_i)  d Y_i / d x_j`, where :math:`Y_i = Y(x,t_i)`.

Performing a non-linear fit
---------------------------

To perform a non-linear fit with GSL Shell you should define before a function that computes the values :math:`f_i` and :math:`J_{ij}` for some given values of the parameters. The details about the function are given in the following section.

.. _fdf-non-linear-descr:

User defined function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user supplied function for the non-linear fit should calculates the values :math:`f_i` and the elements of the Jacobian :math:`J_{ij}` for a given set values of the parameters.
The function is called with the following calling convention::

   function fdf(x, f, J)
      -- user defined function
      ...
   end

where the function ``fdf`` is the function that you provide, ``x`` is column matrix that contains the P parameters, ``f`` is a column matrix of size N used to store the values :math:`f_i`  and J is a matrix of size N x P whose generic element :math:`J_{ij}` is the derivative of :math:`f_i` with respect of the j-th fit parameter.

In some cases the function can be called with ``f`` or ``J`` equal to ``nil`` because their values does not need to be computed. This imply that the user defined function should always check the argument ``f`` and ``J`` and set their values only if the variable is not ``nil``.

For example let us suppose that we want to fit the function

.. math::
   f(t) = A \, e^{ - \lambda t} + b

where A, |lgr| and b are the fit parameters. Let us suppose also that we have samples the data at N different values of t = t\ :sub:`1`, ..., t\ :sub:`i`, ..., t\ :sub:`N`. If this case the vector ``x`` will have size P, ``f`` size N and ``J`` size N x P. The function for the non-linear fit can be therefore defined as follows::

   use 'math'

   function fdf(x, f, J)
      for i=1, n do
         local A, lambda, b = x[1], x[2], x[3]
         local t, y, sig = i-1, yrf[i], sigrf
         local e = exp(- lambda * t)
         if f then f[i] = (A*e+b - y)/sig end
         if J then
            J:set(i, 1, e / sig)
	    J:set(i, 2, - t * A * e / sig)
	    J:set(i, 3, 1 / sig)
	  end
       end
    end


You can note in the definition above the we have chosen to store the three parameters A, |lgr| and b in this exact order. In general you should choose an order to pack the parameters into the vector ``x``.

Note also that the assignment to the elements of the vector ``f`` and the matrix ``J`` are done only if their respective variables ``f`` and ``J`` are not ``nil``.

Once that the function is defined the most delicate work is done and you should create a non-linear fit solver of the appropriate size N and P with the function :func:`num.nlinfit`. Once the non-linear fit solver is defined you indicate the function ``fdf`` and the values using the method :meth:`~NLinFit.set`. Then you should iterate the search procedure with the method :meth:`~NLinFit.iterate` and test the convergence with the method :meth:`~NLinFit.test`.

Here a complete example::

   use 'math'
   use 'graph'

   n = 40

   sigrf = 0.1

   function fdf(x, f, J)
      for i=1, n do
         A, lambda, b = x[1], x[2], x[3]
         t, y, sig = i-1, yrf[i], sigrf
         e = exp(- lambda * t)
         if f then f[i] = (A*e+b - y)/sig end
         if J then
   	 J:set(i, 1, e / sig)
   	 J:set(i, 2, - t * A * e / sig)
   	 J:set(i, 3, 1 / sig)
         end
      end
   end

   function model(x, t)
      A, lambda, b = x[1], x[2], x[3]
      return A * exp(- lambda * t) + b
   end

   xref = matrix.vec {5, 0.1, 1}

   r = rng.new()

   yrf = matrix.new(n, 1, |i| model(xref, i-1) + rnd.gaussian(r, 0.1))

   s = num.nlinfit {n= n, p= 3}

   s:set(fdf, matrix.vec {1, 0, 0})
   print(s.x, s.chisq)

   for i=1, 10 do
      s:iterate()
      print('ITER=', i, ': ', s.x, s.chisq)
      if s:test(0, 1e-8) then break end
   end

   p = plot('Non-linear fit example')
   pts = ipath(iter.sequence(function(i) return i-1, yrf[i] end, n))
   fitln = fxline(function(t) return model(s.x, t) end, 0, n-1)
   p:addline(pts, 'blue', {{'marker', size=5}})
   p:addline(fitln)
   p.clip = false
   p.pad  = true
   p:show()

and here the resulting plot where we have superposed the simulated points with the best fit function.

Solver class definition
-----------------------

.. function:: nlinfit(spec)

   Create a non-linear fit solver object.
   The argument ``spec`` should be a table in the form ``{n = ..., p = ...}`` where the fields n and p indicate, respectively the number of observations and the number of fit parameters.

.. class:: NLinFit

   Non-linear fit solver class.

   .. method:: set(fdf, x0)

      Associate the non-linear fit solver with the user-defined function ``fdf`` and set the initial condition for the fit parameters to ``x0``.
      The definition of the function ``fdf`` is given in the section :ref:`above <fdf-non-linear-descr>`.

   .. method:: iterate()

      Advance the solver of a single step. It does return ``continue`` if it
      did not reach the optimal point and ``success`` otherwise.

   .. method:: test(eps_abs, eps_err)

      Check if the the search converged for the given absolute error ``eps_abs`` and relative error ``eps_rel``.

   .. attribute:: x

      Returns the current vector with the fit parameters.

   .. attribute:: f

      Returns a vector with the fit residuals.
